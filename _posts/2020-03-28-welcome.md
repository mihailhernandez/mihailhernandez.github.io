Hey reader.
This blog contains my Github and other code-related projects. This is my first post on the site and
will present a short navigational article for this particular blog.

For future reference I would like to add to this blog the following projects that are each wrapped in a post article:

- HackerRank solutions and explanations
- .vimrc file and other configurations related to vim
- ScheGen (my senior year of high school project that earned my system programming certification)
- One simple project with neural networks (that explains them and how the work for my learning)
